Check Website at link- https://food-order-site.herokuapp.com/
Food Ordering Website created using React, Node, Express and MongoDB.
(website development is in progress...)

It plans to recieve orders from three top restaurants in Lucknow |
Though present work till now is majorly frontend related but i have futher plans to make a propper functional backend |
In this project, I learnt and implemented frontend through React along with use of React-Bootstrap and Material-UI |
and after that i explored backend from scratch which includes Node, Express in creating server then explored MongoDB for handling database |
I also created Mongoose Schema for menu items which has proper GET and POST calls |
I also explored REST API calls and AXIOS too which will be implemented on this project in near future |
Authentication and Authorization will also be implemented at last
